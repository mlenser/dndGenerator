## Deployment

Currently the website is hosted on [Azure Website](https://azure.microsoft.com/â€Ž)
It is linked to the GitHub repository https://github.com/Cellule/dndGenerator.

In order to publish to azure you need to follow these steps.
- Commit and push all your development work in master
- Merge master to the [release](https://github.com/Cellule/dndGenerator/tree/release) branch
  - If there are any conflicts on the `build` folder, you can safely ignore them (resolve using theirs for instance)
- Build the app in console
  - `npm install` to refresh modules
  - `npm run build` to build
- Commit and push the changes in the `build` folder to the release branch
- Make sure to add any new image in \build\public\, they might have a weird name though!

Once a new commit is pushed on the `release` branch, Azure will detect and publish your new code automatically.
It might take a few minutes to deploy (usually really fast).
